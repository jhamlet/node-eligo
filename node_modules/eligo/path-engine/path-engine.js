    key     'type'
    keys    ['type', 'id']
    range   {from: 0, to: 9}
    ranges  [{from: 0, to: 9}, {from: 20, to: 29}]
    index   1
    indexes [1, 2, 3]
    clause  { where: {key: { is: 'foo'}}}

    index is equivalent to key
    indexes is equivalent to keys
    range is equivalent to keys if you expand the range to its indices
    ranges is equivalent to keys if you expand all the ranges

    ultimately they are all just keys
